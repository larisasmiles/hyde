# Hyde Directory Contents
#
# _output - This is where we’ll eventually put our generated site contents. Users generally won’t actually work with files in this directory. Rather, they will be generated from the other source (markdown) files in the project
# source/ - This directory will house our “input” files. To “build” our site, we’ll process all the files and subdirectories in this directory and transfer them to the _output directory in the appropriate format.
# source/css - This directory will contain stylesheets that users can use to style their sites
# source/index.markdown - This markdown file will eventually become our site’s index.html. By convention a site’s index.html is used as its root page.
# source/pages - Markdown files in this directory will become standalone pages at the appropriate url. For example a file at source/pages/pizza.markdown could be viewed at my-site.com/pages/pizza.html
# source/posts - Another “source” directory – markown files in this directory will be used similarly to those in pages.
